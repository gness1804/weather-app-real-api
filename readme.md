##Weather App

This is a weather app build on the [Weathrly](https://github.com/gness1804/weathrly) app that I completed at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://www.turing.io/). It improves on the intial project by using a real API from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/). While the earlier project only allowed the user to choose four cities and employed artificial data, this app allows the user to choose any U.S. city and displays actual weather data.

Special thanks to my partner from the earlier project, [Kristen Burgess](https://github.com/kristenburgess25), who did most of the styling for that project, much of which I retain in this version. She also pitched in for the JS and React.
